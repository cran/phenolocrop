Description: Fit a time-series model 
    to a crop phenology data, such as time-series rice canopy height.
    This package returns the model parameters as the summary statistics of crop phenology,
    and these parameters will be useful to characterize the growth pattern of each cultivar and 
    predict manually-measured traits, such as days to heading and biomass.
    Please see Taniguchi et al. (2022) <doi:10.3389/fpls.2022.998803> for detail.
